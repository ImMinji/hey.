<h2>Here's the best memory</h3>
I entered 부경대학교 as Master course. When I went there, there was no person who is same ages like me.
<br>but I met somesones Who come from Indonesia. They were exchange students. So that even I didn't know How to comuicate in English I tried.
<br>So I could make friends. We hung out several times. It was so great!
Unfortunatlly time flew by, They had to go. It wasn't End because I visit Indonesia
<br>Here is the picture!
